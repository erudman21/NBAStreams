# NBAStreams

Side project to help me learn Python and use PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper), as well as gain experience with web-scraping and GUIs.

Displays clickable links for the NBA games of the current day. Once clicked, the window will change to a list of clickable
streams from the subreddit /r/nbastreams. Only streams from streamers that are verified or approved by /r/nbastreams are shown.

Current state of the GUI:

Example of the list of streams for a game that was clicked:

#### Still in development:<s>
* Team logo icons in the list of the games for the day </s>
* Also displaying the contents of the streams (ex: showing if the stream feed is from the home team or away team)
* Improving the GUI
* Possibly expanding to other sports/streams

#### Even though the streams are from verified/approved streamers I do not suggest using this without some form of Adblocker
