# NBAStreams

Side project to help me learn Python and use PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper), as well as gain experience with web-scraping and GUIs.

Displays clickable links for the NBA games of the current day. Once clicked, the window will change to a list of clickable
streams from the subreddit /r/nbastreams. Only streams from streamers that are verified or approved by /r/nbastreams are shown.

#### Still in development:
<s>* Team logo icons in the list of the games for the day
* Also displaying the contents of the streams (ex: showing if the stream feed is from the home team or away team)
* Improving the GUI
* Possibly expanding to other sports/streams

#### Even though the streams are from verified/approved streamers I do not suggest using this without some form of Adblocker
